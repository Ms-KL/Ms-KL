I am an emerging Developer and actively seeking a role in AI, Development and/or Data. I’m interested in an entry level position and willing and excited to learn new programming languages and skills.

## She Codes Plus Program:
Currently, I am participating in She Codes Plus Program learning HTML, CSS, Python, Django, JavaScript, React and REST. <br>The [She Codes Plus](https://shecodes.com.au/program/plus/) program is a competitive, respected and influential bootcamp that prepares participants for a career in the tech industry.

## OBJECTIVE: 
I am an emerging Developer and actively seeking a role in AI, Development and/or Data. I’m interested in entry level positions and willing and excited to learn new programming languages and skills.

## SUMMARY:

### <i> I'm an emerging developer interested in Python, AI, Data and Software / Game Development.</i>
Currently, I am participating in [She Codes Plus](https://shecodes.com.au/program/plus/) Program learning <b> HTML, CSS, Python, Django, React, REST and JavaScript</b>. I’m also learning Artificial Intelligence through self-learning platforms and Microsoft Certifications. 

In September 2022, I achieved the [Microsoft Azure AI Fundamentals Certification](https://www.credly.com/badges/cf1a19d2-5f6e-49d2-9524-5eb88053f091/), and I'm working towards Microsoft Azure AI Engineer Associate Certification. In 2021 I completed [Data Analysis and Decision Making](https://handbooks.uwa.edu.au/unitdetails?code=MGMT5504) & [Python Programming for Business](https://handbooks.uwa.edu.au/unitdetails?code=BUSN5101) units at UWA with excellent results, fuelling my passion for tech and data. 

In December 2022 I completed my [third She Codes Plus Project](https://www.loom.com/share/fa6a7813a17f41b69c7a54d8ddf87a7a), building a blog using Django, Python, HTML & CSS.
