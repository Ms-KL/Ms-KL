# Welcome to Kristy's GitHub!

I am an emerging Developer actively seeking technical employment opportunities. I‚Äôm interested in entry-level developer positions and am willing and excited to learn new programming languages and skills.

## ‚ú® She Codes Plus Program:
I am currently participating in the [She Codes Plus](https://shecodes.com.au/program/plus/) Program learning: `HTML`, `CSS`, `Python`, `Django`, `Django REST Framework`, `JavaScript` & `ReactJS`. This program is a competitive, respected and influential bootcamp that prepares participants for a career in the tech industry. According to the most recent [Impact Statement](https://shecodes.com.au/impact/) (2021-2022), 72% of She Codes Plus Alumni pivot into tech. The current cohort (2022/2023) had 69x applicants & 27x scholarships offered and I am a Mentor Give-Back Scholarship recipient in the [2022-2023 Cohort](https://shecodes.com.au/blog/introducing-the-she-codes-plus-cohort-for-perth-2022-2023/).
