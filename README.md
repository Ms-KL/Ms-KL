# Welcome to Kristy Leigh's GitHub

I am an emerging Developer and actively seeking a role in AI, Development and/or Data. Iâ€™m interested in entry level positions and willing and excited to learn new programming languages and skills.

Currently, I am participating in [She Codes Plus](https://shecodes.com.au/program/plus/) Program learning <b> HTML, CSS, Python, Django, React, REST and JavaScript</b>. Iâ€™m also learning Artificial Intelligence through self-learning platforms and Microsoft Certifications. 

In September 2022, I achieved the [Microsoft Azure AI Fundamentals Certification](https://www.credly.com/badges/cf1a19d2-5f6e-49d2-9524-5eb88053f091/), and I'm working towards Microsoft Azure AI Engineer Associate Certification. In 2021 I completed [Data Analysis and Decision Making](https://handbooks.uwa.edu.au/unitdetails?code=MGMT5504) & [Python Programming for Business](https://handbooks.uwa.edu.au/unitdetails?code=BUSN5101) units at UWA with excellent results, fuelling my passion for tech and data. 

In December 2022 I completed my [third She Codes Plus Project](https://www.loom.com/share/fa6a7813a17f41b69c7a54d8ddf87a7a), building a blog using Django, Python, HTML & CSS. 

I've recently joined some engaging local projects to supplement my learning in the She Codes Plus program. 
As I learn, I hope to actively contribute to these projects to support my journey into tech and interest in Python: 
* [M.A.C.I Project](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/gamecityperth_testing-robotiq-universalrobots-activity-6950223074730348544-gWx0/) @ Game City Espresso Bar | Programming of a barista robot 
* [NumPy-financial](https://numpy.org/numpy-financial) | Open-Source Python NumPy package of basic financial functions
