# Welcome to Kristy's GitHub!

I'm Junior Developer and She Codes Plus 22/23 student, ready to commence my first role in the tech industry.
<p>In July 2022, I decided to focus full-time on building the skills and knowledge to become a developer and break into the tech industry. I have since joined the She Codes Plus program, built a portfolio demonstrating my knowledge as a developer, contributed to open-source/community projects and attended numerous workshops, conferences and networking events. I'm passionate about continuous self-learning and actively participate in online learning for programming and AI.
