I'm a junior developer <b>fascinated</b> by AI & Data Science ü§ñ, <b>excited</b> by game development and <b>passionate</b> about software engineering üíª.

As a <b>compliance, audit and documentation nerd</b> ü§ì, I bring excellent attention to detail and organisational prowess to every project.

I'm <b>adaptable, curious, and eager</b> to dive into new technologies, and I love attending industry events, workshops and training sessions to stay up-to-date.

I'm an experienced Trainer, Senior Administrator and Bookkeeper, and I have also dabbled in retail management, professional cooking üë©‚Äçüç≥, and <b>voice-over acting</b> careers. You can often find me immersed in D&D üßô, swing dancing, or playing pinball.

Looking for a developer who's project-driven, <b>loves to learn</b> and gets excited by complex database schemas, but <b>oozes enthusiasm and passion</b>? Let's catch up over coffee ‚òï, whisky or a game of pinball, and see how my <b>unique skills will add value</b> to your team!

## üìà Stats:

<br>

![Ms-KL's GitHub Stats](https://github-readme-stats.vercel.app/api?username=Ms-KL)

<br>

![Top Languages](https://github-readme-stats.vercel.app/api/top-langs/?username=Ms-KL)

### **_Most Used Languages Disclaimer:_**

- **Incorrect weighting of Jupyter Notebooks in stats:** <br>
  The GitHub statistics above may be skewed due to the removal of Jupyter Notebooks. These notebooks are counted as .ipynb files, which can result in an incorrect weighting towards this file type and no contributions to Python.

- **Removal of Jupyter Notebooks in stats = Lower Python Stats:**<br>
  To provide a more accurate representation of my top languages, I have removed all Jupyter Notebooks from the statistics. As a result, the Python stats will appear lower than expected.

## ‚ö° Career Transition: My Tech Learning Journey

### _Career Transition Goal:_

Gain a role in (Software or Game) Development and/or Data Science by the end of 2023.

### _Background:_

After over 15 years of experience as a Senior Administrator, Trainer, and Bookkeeper, I commenced a career break in July 2022 to focus on transitioning into the tech industry. Currently, I am participating in relevant courses, self-learning, and community projects, and attending workshops and networking events to gain practical knowledge and experience.
